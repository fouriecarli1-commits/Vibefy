-- =============================================================================
-- A second step, required at the action rather than at the door.
--
-- Anré's decision, asked for and given: enforce it server-side on the handful
-- of actions that matter, not on every sign-in. Requiring an authenticator app
-- of a solo builder trying a free assessment costs us the customer and buys
-- them nothing — their account holds one unassessed application. The actions
-- below are the ones where somebody else's reputation or somebody else's
-- findings are at stake.
--
-- ## Why this is in the database and not in a server action
--
-- `apps/web` already refuses these at the action, and that refusal is worth
-- having because it can explain itself. It is not the enforcement. Every one of
-- these writes goes through PostgREST with the anon key and a user's access
-- token, so anything the web layer decides can be skipped by not using the web
-- layer. The rule has to be true where the row is written.
--
-- ## Why `as restrictive`
--
-- Permissive policies are ORed. `public.memberships` already carries two that
-- permit an admin to insert — `memberships_insert_admins` from the foundations
-- migration and `memberships_manage_admins` from the workspaces one — so adding
-- a condition to either of them would have achieved exactly nothing while
-- looking like a control. A restrictive policy is ANDed with all of them, and
-- with any permissive policy somebody adds later without reading this comment.
-- That last part is the point: this is the shape of rule that must not quietly
-- stop applying.
--
-- ## What is deliberately NOT restricted
--
-- **Reading.** Every policy here touches writes only. A reviewer who has not
-- enrolled yet must be able to sign in, see where they are, and reach
-- `/console/security` to enrol — enrolment is in the `auth` schema and none of
-- these policies reach it, so the way out of the restriction is always open.
-- Restricting `select` would lock the operator out of the product on the day
-- this migration runs, which is not a security control, it is an outage.
--
-- **Leaving a workspace.** `delete` on `public.memberships` is untouched. A
-- member may always remove themselves, and requiring a second step to leave is
-- friction with nothing on the other side of it: removal grants no access.
--
-- **A customer reading their own report, submitting their own application, or
-- paying.** Those are the moments where friction costs us somebody and protects
-- nobody. If that judgement is wrong it is one more restrictive policy, and the
-- reasoning is in docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md rather than assumed here.
--
-- ## What happens on the day this runs
--
-- A reviewer or workspace admin whose session is at assurance level one can
-- still sign in and read everything they could read yesterday. The first write
-- below is refused until they enrol a factor at `/console/security`, which
-- upgrades the session in the same breath — Supabase issues a level-two token
-- when the enrolment code is verified. Nobody is locked out; the queue is
-- paused for one person for as long as it takes them to scan a QR code.
-- =============================================================================

-- `aal` is a claim Supabase puts in every access token: `aal1` for a password
-- alone, `aal2` once a factor has been answered. Read through `auth.jwt()` so
-- this says the same thing as the client library does.
--
-- Anything other than `aal2` is false, including a missing claim. A token whose
-- assurance we cannot read has not proved anything, and the whole failure this
-- file guards against is a missing answer counting as a good one.

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The gate on every badge
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- A badge cannot issue without an approved assessment, and an assessment cannot
-- be approved without a row in `public.reviews` — the transition trigger
-- refuses it. So this one policy stands in front of every mark this product
-- will ever put on somebody's website, which is the reason it is first.

create policy reviews_need_second_step on public.reviews
  as restrictive
  for insert to authenticated
  with check (public.session_passed_second_step());

-- Suspension, revocation and reinstatement are updates to a live badge, and
-- revocation is the one action here that is visible to the public within
-- minutes. Insert is included because `badges_write_reviewers` is `for all`.

create policy badges_need_second_step_insert on public.badges
  as restrictive
  for insert to authenticated
  with check (public.session_passed_second_step());

create policy badges_need_second_step_update on public.badges
  as restrictive
  for update to authenticated
  with check (public.session_passed_second_step());

-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Letting another person see somebody's findings
-- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- An invitation and a membership are the two ways a human who is not the
-- customer comes to read a customer's findings. A role change is the third: an
-- admin who can promote is an owner with an extra step.

create policy invitations_need_second_step_insert on public.invitations
  as restrictive
  for insert to authenticated
  with check (public.session_passed_second_step());

-- Update is restricted because a live invitation can be redirected: change the
-- address on one and a stolen password becomes a second account. Withdrawing
-- one is the exception and is deliberately left open — it reduces access, it is
-- what an admin does the moment they realise they invited the wrong person, and
-- a control that stands between somebody and undoing their own mistake is
-- working against the thing it is for. A revoked invitation is dead, so a row
-- that sets `revoked_at` may set anything else with it.
create policy invitations_need_second_step_update on public.invitations
  as restrictive
  for update to authenticated
  with check (public.session_passed_second_step() or revoked_at is not null);

create policy memberships_need_second_step_insert on public.memberships
  as restrictive
  for insert to authenticated
  with check (public.session_passed_second_step());

-- No equivalent exception here. A role change is the escalation, and working
-- out from inside a policy whether a particular change is a promotion or a
-- demotion is the kind of cleverness that is wrong once and silently. An admin
-- who wants to demote somebody in a hurry is an admin who can scan a QR code
-- first; the person they are demoting is not going anywhere.

-- audit-marker: exists (select 1 from pg_proc p join pg_namespace n on n.oid=p.pronamespace where n.nspname='public' and p.proname='accept_invitation')
-- =============================================================================
-- Accepting an invitation, which has never once worked.
--
-- Found while putting a second step in front of the actions that grant somebody
-- access to a customer's findings: the invitation flow was already refused by
-- the policies it goes through, and had been since the workspaces migration.
--
-- Proved against the database rather than read off the page. As the invited
-- user:
--
--   · `select ... from public.invitations where token_sha256 = $1` returns
--     **zero rows**. The only policy on that table is
--     `invitations_manage_admins`, which wants `owner` or `admin` on the
--     organisation — and somebody who has not joined yet holds no role in it.
--   · `insert into public.memberships ...` is refused outright. Both policies
--     that permit an insert want that same role.
--
-- So `acceptInvitation` read nothing, passed `null` to `canAccept`, and told the
-- person "That invitation link is not valid." An agency could invite a
-- colleague, the colleague could click the link, and the answer was that their
-- link was bad — which is the worst available shape for this bug, because it
-- sends them to check the thing that was fine and never mentions us.
--
-- ## Why a function and not two more policies
--
-- A policy letting somebody read invitations addressed to them would make the
-- token hash readable by its holder, and the table stores only a hash precisely
-- because an invitation link is a credential. A policy letting somebody insert
-- their own membership would have to re-check the invitation inside the policy,
-- where a mistake is invisible.
--
-- So the whole exchange is one `security definer` function: hand it the token,
-- it decides, and it either creates the membership and marks the invitation used
-- in a single statement pair, or it raises with the reason. Nothing about the
-- invitation is ever returned to the caller — not the hash, not the
-- organisation, not who invited them. A caller with a token learns only whether
-- it worked and why not.
--
-- ## Why it does not need a second step
--
-- The restrictive policies added alongside this require an authenticator app
-- before somebody may grant another person access to a customer's findings.
-- This is the other side of that: a brand-new colleague, minutes old, who has
-- been granted access rather than granting it. Requiring a factor here would
-- mean the only way into a workspace is to set up an authenticator app first,
-- which is the friction that was explicitly not wanted — and `security definer`
-- means those policies do not apply inside this function, deliberately and in
-- one place where it can be read.
--
-- ## The refusals say the same words the TypeScript did
--
-- `canAccept` in `packages/workspace` still exists and still produces the
-- sentences a person reads. These messages match it deliberately, so the two
-- cannot drift into telling somebody two different things about one link, and a
-- test holds them to each other.
